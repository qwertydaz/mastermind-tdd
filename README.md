# Mastermind-TDD

This is a practise project to learn unit testing and test driven development in Python.
The project itself is based on the boardgame 'Mastermind'.

The standard rules of Mastermind can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Gameplay_and_rules

I can't promise that my version will follow these rules to the letter.

## Important note
Although this might seem counterintuitive, I am not aiming to have a functioning game at the end.
My main goal is to learn the process of test driven development.

A working game loop and user interface are out of scope for now.
